### ðŸ¤– Chatbots in This Repository

In this repository, we have built different chatbot examples using both **paid** and **open-source** LLMs:

- `aap.py` â€” A basic chatbot using **OpenAI keys**
- `localllama.py` â€” A basic chatbot using **Ollama with LLaMA 2**

You can also experiment with **other open-source** (like `Mistral`, `Gemma`, etc.) or **paid LLMs** (like `Claude`, `GPT-4`, `Cohere`) by swapping the model configuration in the code.
